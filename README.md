Early fault detection in machinery can save millions of dollars in emergency maintenance cost. Different techniques are used for fault analysis such as short time Fourier transforms (STFT), Wavelet analysis (WA), cepstrum analysis, Model based analysis, etc. we have doing detecting bearing faults using FFT and by using Wavelet analysis more specifically wavelet Analysis up to two levels of approximations and detail components. The analysis is carried out offline in MATLAB. Diagnosing the faults before in hand can save the millions of dollars of industry and can save the time as well. It has been found that Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings has enabled cost saving of over 50% as compared with the old traditional methods. The most common method of monitoring the condition of rolling element bearing is by using vibration signal analysis. Measure the vibrations of machine recorded by velocity

* [ShelvanLee/XFEM](https://github.com/ShelvanLee/XFEM) -  # XFEM_Fracture2D  ### Description  This is a Matlab program that can be used to solve fracture problems involving arbitrary multiple crack propagations in a 2D linear-elastic solid based on the principle of minimum potential energy. The extended finite element method is used to discretise the solid continuum considering cracks as discontinuities in the displacement field. To this end, a strong discontinuity enrichment and a square-root singular crack tip enrichment are used to describe each crack. Several crack growth criteria are available to determine the evolution of cracks over time; apart from the classic maximum tension (or hoop-stress) criterion, the minimum total energy criterion and the local symmetry criterion are implemented implicitly with respect to the discrete time-stepping.   ### Key features   * *Fast:* The stiffness matrix and the force vector (i.e. the equations' system) and the enrichment tracking data structures are updated at each time step only with respect to the changes in the fracture topology. This ultimately results in the major part of the computational expense in the solution to the linear system of equations rather than in the post-processing of the solution or in the assembly and updating of the equations. As Matlab offers fast and robust direct solvers, the computational times are reasonably fast.  * *Robust.* Suitable for multiple crack propagations with intersections. Furthermore, the stress intensity factors are computed robustly via the interaction integral approach (with the inclusion of the terms to account for crack surface pressure, residual stresses or strains). The minimum total energy criterion and the principle of local symmetry are implemented implicitly in time. The energy release rates are computed based on the stiffness derivative approach using algebraic differentiation (rather than finite differencing of the potential energy). On the other hand, the crack growth direction based on the local symmetry criterion is determined such that the local mode-II stress intensity factor vanishes; the change in a crack tip kink angle is approximated using the ratio of the crack tip stress intensity factors.  * *Easy to run.* Each job has its own input files which are independent form those of all other jobs. The code especially lends itself to running parametric studies. Various results can be saved relating to the fracture geometry, fracture mechanics parameters, and the elastic fields in the solid domain. Extensive visualisation library is available for plotting results.  ### Instructions  1. Get started by running the demo to showcase some of the capabilities of the program and to determine if it can be useful for you. At the Matlab's command line enter:  ```Matlab >> RUN_JOBS.m ```  This will execute a series of jobs located inside the *jobs directory* `./JOBS_LIBRARY/`. These jobs do not take very long to execute (around 5 minutes in total).  2. Subsequently, you can pick one of the jobs inside `./JOBS_LIBRARY/` by defining the job title:  ```Matlab >> job_title = 'several_cracks/edge/vertical_tension' ```  3. Then you can open all the relevant scripts for this job as follows:  ```Matlab >> open_job ```  The following input scripts for the *job* will be open in the Matlab's editor:  1. `JOB_MAIN.m`: This is the job's main script. It is called when executing `RUN_JOB` (or `RUN_JOBS`) and acts like a wrapper. Notably, it can serve as a convenient interface to run parametric studies and to save intermediate simulation results. 2. `Input_Scope.m`: This defines the scope of the simulation. From which crack growth criteria to use, to what to compute and what results to show via plots and/or movies. To put it simply, the script is a bunch of "switches" that tell the program what the user wants to be done. 3. `Input_Material.m`: Defines the material's elastic properties in different regions or layers (called "phases") of the computational domain. Moreover, it defines the fracture toughness of the material (assumed to be constant in all material phases).  4. `Input_Crack.m`: Defines the initial crack geometry. 5. `Input_BC.m`: Defines boundary conditions, such as displacements, tractions, crack surface pressure (assumed to be constant in all cracks), body loads (e.g. gravity, pre-stress or pre-strain). 6. `Mesh_make.m`: In-house structured mesh generator for rectangular domains using either linear triangle or bilinear quadrilateral elements. It is possible to mesh horizontal layers using different mesh sizes. 7. `Mesh_read.m`: Gmsh based mesh reader for version-1 mesh files. Of course you can use your own mesh reader provided the output variables are of the correct format (see later). 8. `Mesh_file.m`: Specifies the mesh input file (.msh). At the moment, only Gmsh mesh files of version-1 are allowed.  ### Mesh_file.m  A mesh file needs to be able to output the following data or variables:  * `mNdCrd`: Node coordinates, size = `[nNdStd, 2]` * `mLNodS`: Element connectivities, size = `[nElemn,nLNodS]` * `vElPhz`: Element material phase (or region) ID's, size = `[nElemn,1]` * `cBCNod`: cell of boundary nodes, cell size = `{nBound,1}`, cell element size = `[nBnNod,2]`  Example mesh files are located in `./JOBS_LIBRARY/`. Gmsh version-1 file format is described [here](http://www.manpagez.com/info/gmsh/gmsh-2.4.0/gmsh_60.php).  ### Additional notes  * global variables are defined in `.\Routines_AuxInput\Declare_Global.m` * External libraries are `.\Other_Libs\distmesh` and `.\Other_Libs\mesh2d`  ### References  Two external meshing libraries are used for the local mesh refinement and remeshing at the crack tip during crack propagation or prior to a crack intersection with another crack or with a boundary of the domain. Specifically, these libraries, which are located in `.\Other_Libs\`, are the following:  * [*mesh2d*](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/mesh2d/mesh2d.html) by Darren Engwirda * [*distmesh*](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) by Per-Olof Persson and Gilbert Strang.    ### Issues and Support  For support or questions please email [sutula.danas@gmail.com](mailto:sutula.danas@gmail.com).  ### Authors  Danas Sutula, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg.

* [vrdmr/CS273a-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/vrdmr/CS273a-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning) - Introduction to machine learning and data mining  How can a machine learn from experience, to become better at a given task? How can we automatically extract knowledge or make sense of massive quantities of data? These are the fundamental questions of machine learning. Machine learning and data mining algorithms use techniques from statistics, optimization, and computer science to create automated systems which can sift through large volumes of data at high speed to make predictions or decisions without human intervention. Machine learning as a field is now incredibly pervasive, with applications from the web (search, advertisements, and suggestions) to national security, from analyzing biochemical interactions to traffic and emissions to astrophysics. Perhaps most famously, the $1M Netflix prize stirred up interest in learning algorithms in professionals, students, and hobbyists alike. This class will familiarize you with a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning, and prepare you for research or industry application of machine learning techniques. Background  We will assume basic familiarity with the concepts of probability and linear algebra. Some programming will be required; we will primarily use Matlab, but no prior experience with Matlab will be assumed. (Most or all code should be Octave compatible, so you may use Octave if you prefer.) Textbook and Reading  There is no required textbook for the class. However, useful books on the subject for supplementary reading include Murphy's "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective", Duda, Hart & Stork, "Pattern Classification", and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, "The Elements of Statistical Learning".
